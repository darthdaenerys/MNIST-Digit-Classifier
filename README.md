# MNIST Digit Classifier model

The MNIST database is available at http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/

The MNIST database of handwritten digits, has a training set of 60,000 examples, and a test set of 10,000 examples. It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

**Note** : Your browser may uncompress these files without telling you. If the files you downloaded have a larger size than the above, they have been uncompressed by your browser.

It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.

There are four files available, which contain separately train and test, and images and labels.
